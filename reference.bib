abstract = "Summary Background Tuberculosis remains a substantial public health burden in China. The cure rate in treatment programmes has been about 50%. In 1991, a new project based on directly observed short-course chemotherapy was introduced. We report the results of the first 112 842 patients treated. Methods Patients with symptoms suggesting tuberculosis are referred by general health services to the tuberculosis county dispensary for physical examination and fluoroscopy. Those with suspicious findings submit three sputum samples for smear examination. Village doctors deliver free, directly observed therapy to all smear-positive patients on an outpatient basis. New cases are treated with streptomycin (750 mg), isoniazid (600 mg), pyrazinamide (2000 mg), and rifampicin (600 mg) every other day for 2 months, followed by 4 months of alternate-day isoniazid plus rifampicin. Previously treated patients receive streptomycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin, and ethambutol (1250 mg) every other day for 2 months, followed by 6 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Patients are re-examined and smears are repeated at 2 months (then 3 months if still positive) and at 5 and 6 months (new cases) or 5 and 8 months (previously treated cases). Findings Nearly 1·6 million patients with suspected tuberculosis were referred for fluoroscopy between 1991 and 1994. 48% had suspicious findings on fluoroscopy and underwent sputum examination. 104444 new smear-positive cases and 95 616 previously treated smear-positive cases have been diagnosed. Results of treatment for those enrolled up to the first quarter of 1994 show cure rates of 89·7% among new cases (55213) and 81·1% among those previously treated (57 629). The failure rate in previously treated cases, an indicator of drug resistance, fell from 17·6% among 437 patients enrolled in 1991 to 6·2% among 7822 patients enrolled in the first quarter of 1994. Interpretation Our experience shows that high rates of compliance and cure can be achieved on a mass scale and in a short time by means of directly observed short-course chemotherapy and the WHO technical strategy for effective tuberculosis control."

abstract = "Summary
Background
China has 1·4 million new cases of tuberculosis every year, more than any country except India. A new tuberculosis control project based on short-course chemotherapy was introduced in half the country in 1991, after a national survey of tuberculosis prevalence in 1990. Another survey was done in 2000 to re-evaluate the national tuberculosis burden, providing the opportunity to assess the effect of the control project.
Methods
The survey in 2000 identified 375 599 eligible individuals at 257 investigation points chosen from all 31 mainland provinces by stratified random sampling. Children (aged 0–14 years) were suspected of having tuberculosis if they had an induration of 10 mm or greater after a tuberculin skin test, and an abnormal fluorograph. Adults were suspected if they had a persistent cough, abnormal fluorograph, or both. Tuberculosis was diagnosed by chest radiograph, sputum-smear microscopy, and culture.
Findings
365 097 people were examined (97% of those eligible). Prevalences of pulmonary, culture-positive, and smear-positive tuberculosis in 2000 were 367 (95% CI 340–397), 160 (144–177), and 122 (110–137) per 100 000 population, respectively. Between 1990 and 2000, prevalences of these three forms of the disease had fallen, respectively, by 32% (5–68), 37% (7–66), and 32% (9–51) more in areas in which the project was implemented than in non-project areas. For culture-positive disease, a 30% (9–48) reduction was directly attributable to the project.
Interpretation
Between 1991 and 2000, prevalence of tuberculosis was reduced significantly in areas of China by use of short-course chemotherapy following WHO guidelines. We estimate that in 2000, in a population of more than half a billion, there were 382 000 fewer prevalent culture-positive cases and 280 000 fewer prevalent smear-positive cases than there would otherwise have been."

abstract = "Summary
Background
China scaled up a tuberculosis control programme (based on the directly observed treatment, short-course [DOTS] strategy) to cover half the population during the 1990s, and to the entire population after 2000. We assessed the effect of the programme.
Methods
In this longitudinal analysis, we compared data from three national tuberculosis prevalence surveys done in 1990, 2000, and 2010. The 2010 survey screened 252 940 eligible individuals aged 15 years and older at 176 investigation points, chosen by stratified random sampling from all 31 mainland provinces. All individuals had chest radiographs taken. Those with abnormal radiographs, persistent cough, or both, were classified as having suspected tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was diagnosed by chest radiograph, sputum-smear microscopy, and culture. Trained staff interviewed each patient with tuberculosis. The 1990 and 2000 surveys were reanalysed and compared with the 2010 survey.
Findings
From 1990 to 2010, the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis decreased from 170 cases (95% CI 166–174) to 59 cases (49–72) per 100 000 population. During the 1990s, smear-positive prevalence fell only in the provinces with the DOTS programme; after 2000, prevalence decreased in all provinces. The percentage reduction in smear-positive prevalence was greater for the decade after 2000 than the decade before (57% vs 19%; p<0·0001). 70% of the total reduction in smear-positive prevalence (78 of 111 cases per 100 000 population) occurred after 2000. Of these cases, 68 (87%) were in known cases—ie, cases diagnosed with tuberculosis before the survey. Of the known cases, the proportion treated by the public health system (using the DOTS strategy) increased from 59 (15%) of 370 cases in 2000 to 79 (66%) of 123 cases in 2010, contributing to reduced proportions of treatment default (from 163 [43%] of 370 cases to 35 [22%] of 123 cases) and retreatment cases (from 312 [84%] of 374 cases to 48 [31%] of 137 cases; both p<0·0001).
Interpretation
In 20 years, China more than halved its tuberculosis prevalence. Marked improvement in tuberculosis treatment, driven by a major shift in treatment from hospitals to the public health centres (that implemented the DOTS strategy) was largely responsible for this epidemiological effect.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The post-2015 End TB Strategy proposes targets of 50% reduction in tuberculosis incidence and 75% reduction in mortality from tuberculosis by 2025. We aimed to assess whether these targets are feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and previous programmatic achievements.
Methods
11 independently developed mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active case finding, and preventive therapy.
Findings
Aggressive scale-up of any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets in any country. However, the models projected that, in the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could achieve a 55% reduction in incidence (range 31–62%) and a 72% reduction in mortality (range 64–82%) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets, despite preventing a cumulative 3·4 million cases. The advocacy scenarios illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis.
Interpretation
Major reductions in tuberculosis burden seem possible with current interventions. However, additional interventions, adapted to country-specific tuberculosis epidemiology and health systems, are needed to reach the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets at country level.

and XDR-TB gradually increased from 2005, with MDR-TB reaching a peak in 2008 and XDR-TB in 2009. These data closely mirror national survey data on this region, patient age and occupation.CONCLUSION: Trends in MDR-TB and XDR-TB prevalence during the past decade and their inflection points
were determined, which complemented reports from previous national surveys. This information is useful for fighting TB in China.",

abstract = {ABSTRACT Background and objective Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge. China accounts for more than 10\% of the global TB burden, and effective modelling of TB trends remains limited. Methods We used data drawn primarily from two Chinese nation-wide cross-sectional epidemiological surveys combined with data from China's National Disease Reporting Network to construct an eight-state Markov model that simulates TB prevalence. By adjusting the relevant parameters, we evaluated which characteristics have the greatest bearing upon prevalence and efficacy of the response measures. Results If current trends continue, the prevalence of TB in China will enter an 8-year period of decline from approximately 390 to 200 cases per 100 000 population and stabilize at 163 cases per 100 000 population, which is a figure well above the World Health Organization (WHO) goal of eliminating TB by 2050. We find that the proportion of notified cases in the population, the rate of progression from latent to active and the overall treatment success rate are the chief factors affecting disease progression. Conclusion We suggest a 90-90-90 strategy, wherein the proportion of notified cases in the population reaches 90\%, the risk of progression from latent to active is decreased by 90\% compared with the current level and the overall treatment success rate is increased to 90\%. This strategy could reduce TB prevalence to less than 10 cases per 100 000 population within 5 years and to 1.77 cases per 100 000 population within 50 years.},

A realistic modelization of these contact routes is needed to appropriately assess the impact of individually targeted control strategies, such as contact network investigation of index cases and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI). We propose an age-structured, socio-demographic individual based model (IBM) with a realistic, time-evolving structure of preferential contacts in a population. In particular, transmission within households, schools and workplaces, together with a component of casual, distance-dependent contacts are considered. We also compared the model against two other formulations having no social structure of contacts (homogeneous mixing transmission): a baseline deterministic model without age structure and an age-structured IBM. The socio-demographic IBM better fitted recent longitudinal data on TB epidemiology in Arkansas, USA, which serves as an example of a low burden setting. Inclusion of age structure in the model proved fundamental to capturing actual proportions of reactivated TB cases (as opposed to recently transmitted) as well as profiling age-group specific incidence. The socio-demographic structure additionally provides a prediction of TB transmission rates (the rate of infection in household contacts and the rate of secondary cases in household and workplace contacts). These results suggest that the socio-demographic IBM is an optimal choice for evaluating current control strategies, including contact network investigation of index cases, and the simulation of alternative scenarios, particularly for TB eradication targets."

ABSTRACT={For millennia tuberculosis has shown a successful strategy to survive, making it one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases. This resilient behavior is based not only on remaining hidden in most of the infected population, but also by showing slow evolution in most sick people. The course of the disease within a population is highly related to its heterogeneity. Thus, classic epidemiological approaches with a top-down perspective have not succeeded in understanding its dynamics. In the past decade a few individual-based models were built, but most of them preserved a top-down view that makes it difficult to study a heterogeneous population.

We propose an individual-based model developed with a bottom-up approach to studying the dynamics of pulmonary tuberculosis in a certain population, considered constant. Individuals may belong to the following classes: healthy, infected, sick, under treatment, and treated with a probability of relapse. Several variables and parameters account for their age, origin (native or immigrant), immunodeficiency, diabetes, and other risk factors (smoking and alcoholism). The time within each infection state is controlled, and sick individuals may show a cavitated disease or not that conditions infectiousness. It was implemented in NetLogo because it allows non-modelers to perform virtual experiments with a user-friendly interface.

The simulation was conducted with data from Ciutat Vella, a district of Barcelona with an incidence of 67 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013. Several virtual experiments were performed to relate the disease dynamics with the structure of the infected subpopulation (e.g., the distribution of infected times). Moreover, the short-term effect of health control policies on modifying that structure was studied. Results show that the characteristics of the population are crucial for the local epidemiology of tuberculosis. The developed user-friendly tool is ready to test control strategies of disease in any city in the short-term.}

    abstract = { (1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection. }

    abstract = { In a previous communication an attempt was made to investigate mathe­matically the course of an epidemic in a closed population of susceptible individuals. In order to simplify the problem certain definite assumptions were made, namely, that all individuals were equally susceptible, and that death resulted, or complete immunity was conferred, as the result of an attack. The infectivity of the individual and his chances of death or recovery were represented by arbitrary functions, and the chance of a new infection occurring was assumed to be proportional to the product of the infected and susceptible members of the population. In spite of the introduction of the arbitrary functions, it was shown that in general a critical density of population existed, such that if the actual density was less than this, no epidemic could occur, but if it exceeded this by n an epidemic would appear on the introduction of a focus of infection, and further that if n was small relative to the population density, the size of the epidemic would be 2n per unit area. It was shown that these conclusions could be readily extended to the case of a metaxenous disease, that is, one in which transmission takes place through an intermediate host. It is the purpose of the present paper to consider the effect of the continuous introduction of fresh susceptible individuals into the population. It appeared desirable to investigate this point, since it might make it possible to interpret certain aspects of the incidence of disease not only in human communities where there is usually an influx of fresh susceptible individuals either by immigration or by birth, but also in the animal experiments carried out by Topley and others—where fresh animals were introduced at a constant rate into the cages in which cases of disease were already present—from which certain definite results were obtained. }

    abstract = { In a previous paper (Part II of this series) an attempt was made to treat from a general point of view the problem of a single disease in a population which consisted of three categories of people—namely, never infected, sick and recovered—and in which the infectivity of the disease was a function of the period of illness, whilst the susceptibility of a recovered person was a function of the period which had elapsed since the time of his recovery. New individuals entering the population either by birth or by immigration naturally entered the category of the never infected which for convenience we called “virgins.” It was pointed out that the results obtained were subject to two important limitations: (1) that the disease under consideration was the only cause of death, and (2) that the age of the individuals did not affect their infectivity, susceptibility or reproductiveness. It is the purpose of the present paper to remove the first of these limitations by the introduction of constant non-specific death rates, which for the sake of generality are assumed to be different for virgins, sick, and recovered. It may be stated at once that the introduction of this additional factor produces surprisingly little change in the general nature of the results previously obtained, and that the conclusions of the previous paper hold with very little modification. }

abstract="Mathematical and computational approaches are important tools for understanding epidemic spread patterns and evaluating policies of disease control. In recent years, epidemiology has become increasingly integrated with mathematics, sociology, management science, complexity science, and computer science. The cross of multiple disciplines has caused rapid development of mathematical and computational approaches to epidemic modeling. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive review of epidemic models to provide an insight into the literature of epidemic modeling and simulation. We introduce major epidemic models in three directions, including mathematical models, complex network models, and agent-based models. We discuss the principles, applications, advantages, and limitations of these models. Meanwhile, we also propose some future research directions in epidemic modeling.",

These formulations can be continuous or discrete (in either the state-variable values or time), deterministic or stochastic, or spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous, the latter often embracing a network formulation. Here we review the continuous and discrete deterministic and discrete stochastic formulations of the SIR dynamical systems models, and we outline how they can be easily and rapidly constructed using Numerus Model Builder, a graphically-driven coding platform. We also demonstrate how to extend these models to a metapopulation setting using NMB network and mapping tools."

	abstract = {A new mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) with the intervention of vaccination in an age-structured susceptible population is designed and analyzed in this article. The model is constructed as an SEIR-based system of ten-dimensional ordinary differential equation. Each population is then further classified according to its age-class; children (<15 years old) and adult (15-65 years old). In the susceptible population, the classification goes even further by taking vaccination criteria into account. Mathematical analysis of the equilibrium points and its local stability is performed, both analytically and numerically, to help understand the possibility of the situation in the field for long-term behavior. We also show the form of the basic reproduction number as the spectral radius of the next- generation matrix. The basic reproduction number will become the threshold parameter to handle the existence of equilibrium points. Numerical simulations of the model are done for various scenarios to provide a better understanding of the analytical results. We can conclude that the vaccination strategy is successful in suppressing the spread of TB among the human population.}

The idea is by dividing the population between those who have diabetes and who does not have diabetes.

In this paper, the optimal vaccination strategy for a constrained time-varying SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) epidemic model is solved under the frame of constrained optimal control problems. Three time-varying factors, i.e., seasonally varying incidence coefficient, monotonic decreasing successfully immune rate and monotonic increasing vaccine yield are considered. Constraints on vaccination rate, susceptible population and vaccine supply at each time instant, which are pure-control constraint, pure-state constraint and mixed state-control constraint, respectively, are all taken into consideration. The characterization for the optimal control is derived with the help of the Pontryagin's maximum principle. And optimal control problems are successfully solved by a symplectic pseudospectral method numerically. Numerical results are consistent with the analytical ones. Finally, comparisons of different cases demonstrate that time-varying factors could alter the optimal vaccination strategy, which implies that omitting the time-varying factors may result in less optimal even unreasonable control strategy."

We investigated IP-10 as a potential biomarker for LTBI among household contacts exposed to sputum positive active TB cases.   Methods Active TB cases and contacts were recruited into a cohort with six months’ follow-up. Contacts were tested for LTBI using QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN) assay and the tuberculin skin test (TST). Baseline supernatants from the QFN assay of 237 contacts and 102 active TB cases were analysed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific and mitogen specific IP-10 responses.   Results Contacts with LTBI (QFN+TST+) had the highest MTB specific IP-10 responses at baseline, compared to uninfected contacts (QFN-TST-) p<0.0001; and active cases, p = 0.01. Using a cut-off of 8,239 pg/ml, MTB specific IP-10 was able to diagnose LTBI with a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% CI, 76.2–94.3) and specificity of 90.9% (95% CI, 81.3–96.6). MTB specific to mitogen specific IP-10 ratio was higher in HIV negative active TB cases, compared to HIV negative latently infected contacts, p = 0.0004. Concentrations of MTB specific IP-10 were higher in contacts with TST conversion (negative at baseline, positive at 6-months) than in those that were persistently TST negative, p = 0.001.   Conclusion IP-10 performed well in differentiating contacts with either latent or active TB from those who were uninfected but was not able to differentiate LTBI from active disease except when MTB specific to mitogen specific ratios were used in HIV negative adults. In addition, IP-10 had the potential to diagnose ‘recent TB infection’ in persons classified as having LTBI using the TST. Such individuals with strong IP-10 responses would likely benefit from chemoprophylaxis.},

% ************************************************************
% Below are some papers on stochastic individual/agent based models (IBM)

% NOTE: Generally speaking, IBM's are more like a way of thinking, a perspective, a (general) methodology, rather than a specific systematic method.
% You can surely find some mathematical basis, e.g. the contact matrix, for IBM's, but they are really far more complicated than that.
% Unlike differential equation models such as SIR, SEAIR, and etc, which typically have explicit mathematical equations/structures, and have very specific and realistic meanings for the terms in the equations, IBM does not provide a specific math equation.
% Most of the IBM's are based off very large simulation systems that simulate the individuals, the households, the traffic, the weather, and lots of other stuff in the whole city, down to quite small details.
% For example, EpiSimS was originally based off TranSims, which gather its data from the government and national institutes, and literally simulates every person in an city, e.g. New York, when the person leaves home, what kind of transportation does he take, where he works, whether he sneezes, where the wind leads to the sneeze to, how he interacts with his colleagues, and more and more. Some of the IBM's even support communication between multiple cities.
% For this reason, IBM's are usually softwares, packages, or language libraries (MASON is a Java library). Some are even directly implemented by hardwares, planted at various military bases in the US, and not publicly available. They are not math equations, but rather entire systems.
% The IBM's are significantly complicated, and meanwhile significantly realistic and useful.
% For example, you can even model how many vaccines each hospital receive, which schools are closed, which people are quarantined, and what effects the measures will have. By contrast, in the ODE model, the measures are usually just a single number, named blah-blah rate, with who-knows-how-much correspondence it has with reality,

Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established.

A primary concern of epidemiologists is investigating the spread of infectious diseases. Computer Scientists can provide powerful tools for epidemiologists to study such diseases. The existing simulation approaches available to epidemiologists are fast becoming obsolete, with data being stored in newer formats like GIS formats. There is an urgent need for developing computationally powerful, user-friendly tools that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of disease spread. We present a survey of the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling and discuss the unique features of our chosen technique. Our agent-based approach effectively models the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases in spatially-delineated environments by using agents to model the interaction between people and pathogens. We present preliminary results of modeling an actual tuberculosis disease outbreak in a local shelter. This model is an important step in the development of user-friendly tools for epidemiologists.",

Transmission matrices can be used to estimate age-dependent forces of infection in age-structured, compartmental models for the study of infectious diseases. We analyze the social network generated by the synthetic population of Portland and extract mixing patterns. Our results show that the mixing within the population consists of two groups, children and adults. Children interact most frequently with other children close to their own age, while adults interact with a wider range of age groups and the durations of typical adult contacts are shorter than typical contacts between children. Furthermore, the transmission matrix shows that children are more likely to acquire infection than adults."

This paper describes the assumptions and methodology in the EpiSimS model. It also describes and presents a simulation of the spatial dynamics of pandemic influenza in an artificial society constructed to match the demographics of southern California. 

As an example of the utility of the massive simulation approach, we demonstrate a strong correlation between local demographic characteristics and pandemic severity, which gives rise to previously unanticipated spatial pandemic hotspots. In particular, the average household size in a census tract is strongly correlated with the clinical attack rate computed by the simulation. Public heath agencies with responsibility for communities having relatively high population per household should expect to be more severely hit by a pandemic.},

    abstract = { Rationale: Household contact tracing has recently been endorsed for global tuberculosis (TB) control, but its potential population-level impact remains uncertain.Objectives: To project the maximum impact of household contact tracing for TB in a moderate-burden setting.Methods: We developed a stochastic, agent-based simulation model of a simplified TB epidemic, calibrated to a setting of moderate TB incidence. We used data from the literature to generate “community-driven” and “household-driven” scenarios in which 22 and 50\% of TB transmission occurred within the household, respectively. In each scenario, we simulated an intervention in which the household members are screened and treated for TB at the time of an index patient’s active TB diagnosis.Measurements and Main Results: By the time of TB diagnosis, 75 to 95\% of initial household infections had already occurred, but only 1.5 to 3.0\% of contacts had sufficient time to progress to active TB. With 100\% sensitive tracing of all contacts for 5 consecutive years, TB incidence declined by 10 to 15\%, with a mean year-over-year decline of 2\% per year. Effects were sustained for many years after stopping the intervention. Providing preventive therapy with contact tracing nearly doubled this impact (17–27\% decline in incidence). Impact was proportional to sensitivity and coverage; thus, if 50\% of contacts were screened with a 50\% sensitive test, TB incidence declined by only 0.5\% per year.Conclusions: Household contact tracing is unlikely to transform TB epidemiology in isolation but has the potential, especially with provision of preventive therapy, to augment a comprehensive package of interventions that could substantially reduce the population-level burden of TB. }

    abstract = { Tuberculosis is an old disease which co-exists with humans. It claims for over 10 million new infections and deaths annually. According to the World Health Organization TB facts, about one-third of the world's population has latent TB, and drug resistant strains have been found in all countries surveyed.1,2 With rapid spread of multi-drug resistance, TB has become a global public health challenge. Understanding the dynamics of TB infection and the interplay between confounding factors involved in the emergence and spread of drug-resistance is crucial for addressing this growing challenge. While mathematical models have contributed to enhance our understanding of the TB infection mechanisms and control,3–6 the perplexity of this disease calls for application of more advanced and computationally sophisticated methods.7 Here, we propose an agent-based modelling computational system as a general framework to study TB infection and interrelated processes. This framework includes two strains of TB, namely drug-sensitive and drug-resistant, and encapsulates principal mechanisms of latent, endogenous, exogenous, and relapse infection. This paper is concerned with the development of this framework both epidemiologically and computationally, with methodologies for model implementation. Using this model, we provide a new pathway towards evaluating treatment strategies for curtailing TB drug-resistant infection. }

	abstract = {Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has been detected in most provinces of South Africa, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal province where several hundred cases have been reported since 2004. We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.},

	abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has raised the concern that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance to antibiotics results in a longer duration of infection in a host, but this resistance may come at a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This raises the question of whether the overall fitness of drug-resistant strains is higher than that of sensitive strains{\textemdash}essential information for predicting the spread of the disease. Here, we directly estimate the transmission cost of drug resistance, the rate at which resistance evolves, and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These estimates are made by using explicit models of the transmission and evolution of sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using approximate Bayesian computation, and molecular epidemiology data from Cuba, Estonia, and Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of drug resistance relative to sensitivity can be as low as 10\%, that resistance evolves at rates of ≈0.0025{\textendash}0.02 per case per year, and that the overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable with that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the contribution of transmission to the spread of drug resistance is very high compared with acquired resistance due to treatment failure (up to 99\%). Estimating such parameters directly from in vivo data will be critical to understanding and responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance, projections using our estimates suggest that the prevalence of tuberculosis may decline with successful treatment, but the proportion of cases associated with resistance is likely to increase.},

    abstract = "{Background. Drug resistance poses a serious challenge for the control of tuberculosis in many settings. It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions.Methods. We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.Results. The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance–conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40\\% increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years.Conclusions. The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance–conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future studies that can better establish the range of fitness costs associated with drug resistance–conferring mutations will improve projections and thus facilitate better public health planning efforts.}",
